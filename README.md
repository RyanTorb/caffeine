.exe file runs in the background and presses the shift key every 40 seconds so that the computer never goes to sleep. 
On my computer it has a cute coffee icon, but who knows if that will be uploaded with the file.
I also attached the .py file, which you can just run.

As always, I'm addressing an abstract "you" -- different versions of this app are already all over the internet.

Have fun draining your computer's battery!
